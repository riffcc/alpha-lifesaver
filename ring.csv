\
Romeo and Juliet is an early tragedy by William Shakespeare about two teenage \"star-cross'd lovers\" whose \"untimely deaths\" ultimately unite their feuding households. The play has been highly praised by literary critics for its language and dramatic effect. It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays. Its influence is still seen today, with the two main characters being widely represented as archetypal young lovers.\

There are many words to describe the artistry of the music behind Alt-hop, Hip-Hop, Trip-hop, Indie-folk-rap, Grunge-Pop vocalist/MC Addiquit. But for now, she has released what she feels is a long awaited (and long playing) album, an EP in fact, to promote her tour of Europe in late 2009. Her self-titled album was released on her record label, Dead Rich Records. An \"official album debut\" is said to be almost complete with a release date of Summer 2010. This ecclectic album displays varying interests in Hip-Hop, Club Rap, Lyrical, Folk and other genres, which truly states a creative, unique, one-of-a-kind artist and a must have debut.\

450,3,0,"It’s hard to think of a better title than Bossa Punk for this recent compilation from Madame Rrose Sélavy. It’s the eighth release from this Belo Horizonte band and is the perfect bookend to the first chapter in the band’s history (as well as an indication of what is to\
 come). Over their previous releases the group fused elements of bossa nova, rock, frevo, electronica and punk to create an always-challenging, often raw, sound. For Bossa Punk they decided to strip down their songs to just guitars and vocals. The results are really quite stunning. \
It’s no surprise that Mais Um Discos chose “Só Um Beijo” for their Rolê: New Sounds of Brazil compilation. It’s one of the album’s major highlights, a simple guitar motif backed by glittering FX and the two vocals layered together on top. As with many great pop songs, it’s the simple things that work and in this song’s bare elements they hit perfection. “Bem Vindo”, “Só Você Não Vê” and “Vida Açucarina” all come close to repeating the trick. It feels that after all the years of playing together the group have finally found a winning formula, languishing in the beauty of their layered vocals with languid guitar-work, and saying goodbye to the thrashing guitars and electro beats that were often prominent in their earlier albums. It means that the album can drag sometimes with so many of the songs treading the same path, hoping that the lyrics and melodies will be enough to ensure each track stands on its own. In truth, they almost have enough great melodies to pull it off. Considering there are 16 tracks this is quite some feat.\
 \
Since they began Madame Rrose Sélavy have often used “bossa” and “punk” to describe their sound. Bossa Punk is their first release to perfectly encapsulate the meaning of those two words together, the simplicity, melodicism and serenity of bossa nova with the attitude and DIY approach of punk. As an introduction to Madame Rrose Sélavy and their five years and eight albums as a band, it couldn’t really be any better.\

LibriVox recording of Bible (DRV) Apocrypha/Deuterocanon: Wisdom of Sirach\
(Ecclesiasticus) by Douay-Rheims Version (DRV).\
\
Read in English by ancientchristian.\
\
The Book of Ecclesiasticus is preceded by a prologue which professes to \\nbe\
the work of the Greek translator of the original Hebrew and the \\ngenuineness\
of which is undoubted. In this preface to his translation, \\nthe writer\
describes how he was deeply impressed by the wisdom of the \\nsayings and so\
wished by his translation to place those valuable \\nteachings within the reach\
of anyone desiring to live in a more perfect \\naccord with the law of God. The\
fundamental thought of the author is \\nthat of wisdom as understood and\
inculcated in inspired Hebrew \\nliterature. The contents may be divided into\
two great parts: chs. \\ni-xlii, 14; and xlii, 15-1, 26. The sayings which\
chiefly make up the \\nfirst part, tend directly to inculcate the fear of God\
and the \\nfulfillment of His commands, wherein consists true wisdom. This they\
do \\nby pointing out, in a concrete manner, how the truly wise man shall\
\\nconduct himself in the manifold relationships of practical life. \\nTogether\
with these maxims, which resemble closely both in matter and \\nform the\
Proverbs of Solomon, the first part includes several more or \\nless long\
descriptions of the origin and excellence of wisdom. The \\ncontents of the\
second part, at first describe at length the Divine \\nwisdom so wonderfully\
displayed in the realm of nature (xlii, 15-xliii),\\n and next illustrate the\
practice of wisdom in the various walks of \\nlife, as made known by the history\
of Israel's worthies, from Enoch down\\n to the high priest Simon, the writer's\
holy contemporary (xliv-1, 26). \\nAt the close of the book, there is first, a\
short conclusion containing \\nthe author's subscription and the express\
declaration of his general \\npurpose; and next, an appendix (li) in which the\
writer returns thanks \\nto God for His benefits, and especially for the gift of\
wisdom and to \\nwhich are subjoined in the Hebrew text recently discovered, a\
second \\nsubscription and the following pious ejaculation: \\\"Blessed be the\
name \\nof Yahweh from this time forth and for evermore.\\\" ( The Catholic\
\\nEncyclopedia (1909) - condensed by ancientchristian)\

LibriVox recording of A Casket of Cameos by Frank W. Boreham.\
\
Frank Boreham was a well known preacher who served in England, Australia, and\
New Zealand. He published dozens of books and thousands of editorials during\
his lifetime, with no sign of slowing down, even up until his death at age 88.\
He wrote with a distinctive style, seeming to be able to draw a spiritual\
lesson out of any conceivable topic. This is the third volume of his \\\"Texts\
That Made History\\\" series, in which he sketches the lives of eminent\
Christians throughout the ages and the specific scriptures from which they each\
drew their inspiration and strength."

\
The First Book of the Machabees is a history of the struggle of the Jewish\
people for religious and political liberty under the leadership of the Machabee\
family, with Judas Machabeus as the central figure. After a brief introduction\
(i, 1-9) explaining how the Jews came to pass from the Persian domination to\
that of the Seleucids, it relates the causes of the rising under Mathathias and\
the details of the revolt up to his death (i, 10-ii); the glorious deeds and\
heroic death of Judas Machabeus (iii-ix, 22); the story of the successful\
leadership of Jonathan (ix, 23-xii), and of the wise administration of Simon\
(xiii-xvi, 17). It concludes (xvi, 18-24) with a brief mention of the\
difficulties attending the accession of John Hyrcanus and with a short summary\
of his reign. The book thus covers the period between the years 175 and 135\
B.C. ( Bechtel, F. (1910). The Books of Machabees. In The Catholic\
Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company.)\

\
The Second Book of Machabees is not, as the name might suggest, a continuation\
of the First, but covers part of the same ground. The book proper is preceded\
by two letters of the Jews of Jerusalem to their Egyptian coreligionists. The\
first dated in 124 B.C., contains only an invitation to the Jews of Egypt to\
celebrate the feast of the Dedication of the Temple. The second which is\
undated, is from the senate and Judas Machabeus to the counsellor of Ptolemy,\
and to the Jews in Egypt. It informs them Egyptian Jews of the death of\
Antiochus, and invites them to celebrate the feasts of the Dedication and of\
the Recovery of the Sacred Fire. The story of the recovery of the sacred fire\
is then related.\
\
The book itself begins with an elaborate preface in which the author after\
mentioning that his work is an epitome of the larger history in five books of\
Jason of Cyrene states his motive in writing the book. The first part relates\
the attempt of Heliodoris, prime minister of Seleucus IV (187-175 B.C.), to rob\
the treasures of the Temple. The rest of the book is the history of the\
Machabean rebellion down to the death of Nicanor (161 B.C.), and therefore\
corresponds to I Mach. II Mach. thus covers a period of only fifteen years,\
from 176 to 161 B.C. But while the field is narrower, the narrative is much\
more copious in details than I Mach., and furnishes many particulars, for\
instance, names of persons, which are not found in the first book. ( Bechtel,\

В силу этого сочетания, на современной сцене проект  занимает почти пустую нишу. \

---\
Complex Numbers (including the Viktor Argonov Project) is a Russian musical group working in different formats from individual tracks to symphonies \
and operas. Our main credo is a combination of accessible melodic electronic music (up to the deliberate exploitation of pop music stamps) and complex intellectual meanings of a scientific, technical and philosophical-futurological plan. Due to this combination, the project occupies an almost empty niche on the modern stage.\
All of the band's music is freely distributed under Creative Commons license BY-SA 4.0. In addition, the group is experimenting with the distribution of open source (open source) to music. The opera \"2032\" is marked on the English-language Wikipedia as the world's first open source opera (see the details on [url=https://zeexlbi4p5qvahbzfxerlcaitu--complexnumbers-ru.translate.goog/2032.html]the[/url] opera [url=https://zeexlbi4p5qvahbzfxerlcaitu--complexnumbers-ru.translate.goog/2032.html]page[/url] )."
